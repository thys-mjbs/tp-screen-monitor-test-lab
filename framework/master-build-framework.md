# Master Build Framework — Free Web Tool Portfolio

*Synthesised from: ChatGPT ideation transcript, Home Hub SEO strategy, Talent Atrium SEO strategy, and Free Web Tool Clusters research report. This document is the universal handoff for any agent building any site in the portfolio.*

---

## 0. Infrastructure Setup (Start Here Every Time)

**Assume nothing exists.** Before writing a single line of code, the agent must confirm each item below with the user. Do not skip this step even if the user says "it's fine" — walk through it methodically so nothing is missed.

### 0.1 Account Checklist

Ask the user to confirm they have each of the following. If any are missing, pause and assist them in creating it before proceeding.

| # | Account | Purpose | Free? |
|---|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | GitHub account | Code repository and version control | Yes |
| 2 | Vercel account | Hosting, deployment, analytics | Yes (Hobby tier) |
| 3 | Google account | Used for GA4, Search Console, AdSense | Yes |
| 4 | Google Analytics 4 property | Page view and event tracking | Yes |
| 5 | Google Search Console property | Index monitoring and sitemap submission | Yes |
| 6 | AdSense account | Display ad revenue | Yes (apply after launch) |
| 7 | Domain registrar account | Custom domain (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.) | Paid (~R200/year) |

Note: AdSense and the custom domain are NOT needed on day one. Get the site live on the Vercel subdomain first, earn some traffic, then add both.

### 0.2 Local Environment Checklist

Confirm the following are installed on the user's machine:

- **Node.js 20 LTS** — download from nodejs.org if not installed. Verify: `node -v`
- **npm** — comes bundled with Node.js. Verify: `npm -v`
- **GitHub Desktop** — for pushing commits to GitHub. User already has this.
- **Code editor** — VS Code recommended. Download from code.visualstudio.com if needed.
- **Git** — comes bundled with GitHub Desktop, so this is already present.

### 0.3 Create the Project Locally

Run the following command in the terminal, replacing `[site-folder-name]` with the site's numbered folder name (e.g. `01-qr-barcode-toolkit`):

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest [site-folder-name] --typescript --tailwind --app --no-src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

When prompted:
- Would you like to use ESLint? → **Yes**
- Would you like to use Turbopack? → **Yes**

Open the project in VS Code: `code [site-folder-name]`

### 0.4 Create the GitHub Repository

Use GitHub Desktop — do NOT create the repo manually on GitHub.com first.

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Go to **File → Add Local Repository**
3. Point it to the project folder you just created
4. Click **"create a repository"** when GitHub Desktop asks
5. Name: use the same folder name (e.g. `01-qr-barcode-toolkit`)
6. Visibility: **Public** (required for Vercel free tier — private repos need a paid Vercel plan)
7. Click **Create Repository**
8. Click **Publish Repository** to push it to GitHub

### 0.5 Connect to Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in
2. Click **Add New → Project**
3. Click **Import** next to the repo you just published
4. Framework Preset will auto-detect as **Next.js** — leave all defaults
5. Click **Deploy**
6. Vercel will build and deploy. The site will go live at a URL like `[project-name].vercel.app`
7. Every future push to the `main` branch on GitHub will auto-deploy to Vercel

### 0.6 Add the Environment Variable

In Vercel, once the project is created:
1. Go to **Project → Settings → Environment Variables**
2. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` = `https://[project-name].vercel.app`
3. Set it for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development**
4. Redeploy once for the variable to take effect

In the local project, create a `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Add `.env.local` to `.gitignore` (it is already there by default in Next.js).

### 0.7 Push vs Pull — The Simple Rule

For solo development on one machine, the flow is always:
1. Build or change something locally
2. In GitHub Desktop: review changed files, write a short commit message, click **Commit to main**
3. Click **Push origin** to send it to GitHub
4. Vercel automatically deploys the push within ~1 minute

**Pull** is only needed if you've made changes on another machine or directly on GitHub.com (rare). Default assumption: **always Push, almost never Pull.**

### 0.8 Custom Domain (Do This Last)

Do not set up the custom domain until the site is fully built, live on the Vercel subdomain, and AdSense is approved.

When ready:
1. Buy the domain from your registrar
2. In Vercel: **Project → Settings → Domains → Add**
3. Enter the domain (e.g. `qrtoolkit.com`)
4. Vercel will show you DNS records to add — copy them into your registrar's DNS settings
5. Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in Vercel environment variables to the new domain
6. Propagation takes 5 minutes to 24 hours

---

## 1. Portfolio Strategy

### The Model
- **Goal:** 20 focused tool sites × 25 tools each = 500 tools total
- **Traffic target:** 500,000 monthly page views across the portfolio
- **Per-tool average:** 1,000 monthly page views after maturation (3–6 months)
- **Per-site target:** 25,000 monthly page views after maturation
- **Revenue assumption:** $3 RPM (conservative) → ~R25,000/month at portfolio scale
- **Cost model:** Each tool site costs approximately R20/month to host; needs R40+/month to break even
- **Timeline:** Month 1 = ~200 views, Month 2 = ~500 views, Month 3+ = 1,000+

### The Gauntlet (Idea Qualification)
Every tool idea must pass as many of these as possible before building:
1. Free tool, no login required
2. One-dimensional — immediately obvious what it does
3. Browser-side or deterministic logic preferred
4. API calls allowed only if ad revenue per session exceeds API cost per session
5. Commercial search intent or commercial adjacency must exist
6. Proven search demand (real queries, real competitors)
7. Beatable competition (weak, slow, thin, outdated, or poorly localised competitors)
8. Natural cluster of 20–25 related tools on one domain
9. Low maintenance (no manual content updates after launch)
10. Easy to explain in under 10 seconds (e.g. via YouTube Shorts)
11. Does not require regulated advice (legal, medical, financial)
12. Can support multiple language versions
13. Can support programmatic SEO pages (variants, use-cases, languages)
14. Internal-link opportunity to at least 3–5 related tools on the same site

### What to Avoid
- Calculator-heavy clusters
- Generic AI writing tools
- Tools requiring user accounts
- Expensive API usage without clear revenue offset
- YMYL (Your Money Your Life) regulated advice
- Tools dominated by Adobe, Google, Microsoft incumbents with no long-tail angle
- Thin duplicate pages without genuinely distinct utility

## 2. Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) | Static generation, `generateStaticParams`, `generateMetadata` |
| Language | TypeScript | Strict mode |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, mobile-first |
| Hosting | Vercel | Zero config, edge CDN, Analytics built-in |
| Database | None (for most tools) | Browser-side only. If data needed: Vercel Postgres or KV |
| Analytics | Google Analytics 4 + Vercel Analytics + Vercel Speed Insights | All three from day one |
| Ads | Google AdSense (primary), Adsterra (fallback) | See Section 7 |

---

## 3. Site Architecture

### URL Structure
```
/                           Homepage (tool hub index)
/tools                      All tools listing (optional, can be homepage)
/[tool-slug]                Individual tool page (core URL)
/[tool-slug]/[variant]      Tool variant pages (language, use-case, device, format)
/blog                       Blog index
/blog/[slug]                Blog post (targets informational queries around tool use cases)
/about                      About page (required for AdSense)
/privacy                    Privacy Policy (required for AdSense)
/terms                      Terms of Service
/contact                    Contact page (required for AdSense)
/sitemap.xml                Auto-generated
/robots.txt                 Auto-generated
```

### Page Types
1. **Tool page** — the core utility, fully functional in-browser
2. **Tool variant page** — same tool, different context (language, device, use-case)
3. **Category hub** — groups related tools with internal links
4. **Blog post** — targets informational queries, links to tool pages
5. **Static legal/about pages** — required for ad approval

## 3.5. Visual Design & Identity

### The Problem to Solve

The majority of utility tool sites launched between 2023–2025 look identical. They share the same default Tailwind blue, the same Inter font at base weight, the same `rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm` card pattern, and the same purple-to-blue gradient hero with floating blurred blobs. Visitors recognize this pattern immediately — consciously or not — and it signals "cheap AI-built template." It erodes trust before the tool even loads.

**The goal:** each site in this portfolio must have a specific visual personality that feels intentional, distinctive, and matching its subject matter. A password security tool should feel serious and precise. A print paper generator should feel warm and tactile. A randomiser should feel playful and energetic.

---

### The Five Generic Tells to Avoid

Never allow any of these in any site build:

1. **The Default Blue** — Tailwind `blue-500` (#3B82F6) as the primary brand color. Thousands of AI-built sites use this exact shade. Choose something offset: a teal, an amber, a slate, a rose, or any deliberate non-default hue.
2. **The Blob Hero** — A gradient background from purple to blue with large blurred CSS `rounded-full` orbs. This pattern became so saturated by 2024 it now signals "AI template" instantly. Do not use it.
3. **The Identical Card** — `rounded-lg border border-gray-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-sm` on every tool card with a small blue icon and a heading. Acceptable as a base, but must be customised: different corner radius approach, a stronger border color, a background tint, or a hover state with visual personality.
4. **The Lifeless Footer** — Four gray text columns on a white background with no identity. The footer should carry the brand: a deeper background color, the logo, a tagline, real personality.
5. **Font Flatness** — Inter at base weight everywhere with no typographic contrast. Headings must have genuine visual weight: either a heavier weight, a different optical size, or a distinct font entirely.

---

### Design System Fundamentals

Every site must define and use a consistent design system. Build this into `tailwind.config.ts` before writing any components.

**Color System Structure:**
```typescript
// tailwind.config.ts
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      brand: {
        50:  '[lightest tint]',
        100: '[light tint]',
        200: '[tint]',
        300: '[mid tint]',
        400: '[light]',
        500: '[base — primary brand color]',
        600: '[dark — hover states]',
        700: '[darker]',
        800: '[very dark]',
        900: '[darkest — backgrounds on dark sites]',
        950: '[near black with hue]',
      },
    },
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['[Chosen Font]', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
      mono: ['[Mono Font]', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.mono],
    },
  }
}
```

**Typography Scale:** Use at least four distinct visual weights/sizes:
- Display heading (hero H1): very large, heavy weight, tight tracking (`tracking-tight font-extrabold`)
- Section heading (H2): large, bold
- Card heading (H3): medium, semibold
- Body: base, regular
- UI label/caption: small, medium weight
- Monospace: for tool outputs, code, and technical values (use `font-mono`)

**Spacing System:** Pick one of these base rhythms and use it consistently:
- 4px base (Tailwind default) — works well, stick to 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64/96 steps
- Never mix arbitrary values like `mt-[17px]` — use the scale

---

### Per-Site Visual Personality

Each site in the portfolio has a distinct mood and color direction. Build the site to match its mood — do not apply a neutral "safe" palette. Use the site-specific `build-framework.md` for the confirmed direction; this table is the guiding principle:

| Site | Mood | Direction | Avoid |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| QR & Barcode Toolkit | Precise, technical | Dark base, cyan/teal accent | Playful or colorful |
| Image Resize & Crop Lab | Creative, visual | Warm white, amber accent | Corporate blue |
| Text Format & Transform Lab | Editorial, typographic | Clean white, deep indigo, monospace touches | Generic card design |
| Password & Security Toolkit | Serious, trustworthy | Near-black base, green for pass / red for fail | Anything that looks playful |
| Unit & Measurement Converter Hub | Measured, utilitarian | Light gray base, steel blue accent | Decorative elements |
| Website Launch Check Lab | Diagnostic, professional | Dark base, green/red status indicators | Purple gradient |
| Ecommerce Image Prep Lab | Retail-forward, clean | White base, orange accent | Dark/moody |
| Creator Upload Prep Lab | Bold, energetic | Dark base, rose/coral accent | Muted or corporate |
| File Inspection & Metadata Lab | Analytical, technical | Off-white base, violet accent, monospace UI | Overly decorative |
| Social Share Preview Lab | Social, vibrant | White base, platform-inspired color hints | Monochrome |
| Print Layout & Paper Lab | Warm, tactile | Cream/warm base, brown accent | Cold or tech |
| Colour Accessibility Lab | Colour-positive, clear | White base, rich multi-color usage (appropriate here) | Black-and-white only |
| Responsive Viewport Preview Lab | Screen-centric, tech | Dark base, sky blue accent | Warm tones |
| Email Preview Lab | Clean, inbox-familiar | Light blue-white base, mid-blue accent | Heavy graphics |
| Marketplace Listing Helper Lab | Commerce, results-oriented | White base, emerald accent | Dark or moody |
| Meeting & Presentation Prep Lab | Professional, structured | Light gray base, deep blue accent | Playful or casual |
| Timers & Focus Lab | Focus, zen, minimal | Pure dark base, amber accent | Distracting decoration |
| Event Utility Lab | Celebratory, warm | Light purple-white base, vivid purple accent | Cold or corporate |
| Randomiser & Picker Lab | Playful, energetic | White base, bold multi-color usage (pick wheel aesthetic) | Muted or serious |
| Job Application Prep Lab | Professional, hopeful | Clean white base, charcoal + teal accent | Anything that looks cheap |

### Recommended Fonts

**Do not use Inter alone.** It is everywhere. Acceptable options that are free, well-optimised, and not overused:

| Font | Personality | Best for | Load via |
|------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Geist** (Vercel) | Clean, technical, slightly distinctive | Technical/dev tools | `next/font/local` |
| **Plus Jakarta Sans** | Friendly, modern, approachable | General utility, ecommerce | `next/font/google` |
| **DM Sans** | Clean with subtle personality | Colour, social, creative tools | `next/font/google` |
| **Outfit** | Clean with more warmth than Inter | Timers, planners, event tools | `next/font/google` |
| **Sora** | Geometric, tech-adjacent | Security, file inspection, password | `next/font/google` |
| **Fraunces** (display only) | Elegant, literary (use for H1 display only) | Print, editorial, text tools | `next/font/google` |

For monospace UI elements (tool outputs, code, technical values): **Geist Mono** or **JetBrains Mono** (both free, both high quality).

Always load fonts via `next/font` — never import from Google Fonts CDN directly (causes FOUT and hurts LCP).

---

### Design Style References

Study these sites before designing. They are not to be copied — they are reference points for the *level of craft* and the *kinds of decisions* that separate distinctive from generic:

| Reference | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| [linear.app](https://linear.app) | Dark theme done with extreme discipline. Spacing, type, animation — all intentional. |
| [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) | Black and white used boldly. No color needed when the design is this considered. |
| [cal.com](https://cal.com) | Open source but looks expensive. Proof that Tailwind can be used with real craft. |
| [transform.tools](https://transform.tools) | Free utility site that looks designed, not generated. Great reference for this portfolio. |
| [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app) | Tool-first design: the tool IS the hero. Everything else is secondary. |
| [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com) | A humble panda mascot became the entire brand identity. Distinctive without trying hard. |
| [regex101.com](https://regex101.com) | Technical, dense, functional — but clearly designed with intent. |
| [excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com) | Strong visual personality from a deliberate style choice (hand-drawn look). |

### AI Image Generation Prompts

Use these prompts in **ChatGPT (GPT-4o image generation)** or **Midjourney** to generate visual assets. Replace bracketed values with site-specific details.

#### Favicon / App Icon

```
Create a minimal app icon for [SITE_NAME]. 
Requirements:
- Single recognisable symbol for [CORE CONCEPT — e.g. "a QR code", "a clock face", "a magnifying glass over a file"]
- Flat design only. No shadows, gradients, bevels, or 3D effects.
- Two colors maximum: [BACKGROUND_COLOR] background with [ICON_COLOR] symbol.
- Rounded square format (like iOS app icon — border radius approximately 22% of width).
- The symbol must read clearly at 32×32 pixels — use bold, simplified shapes only. No fine lines.
- SVG-style clean vector illustration.
- White padding of approximately 20% on all sides inside the rounded square.
Output: 512×512 PNG on transparent background.
```

Example for QR & Barcode Toolkit:
```
Create a minimal app icon. Single symbol: a simplified QR code using only the three corner finder squares (L-shape), bold and clean. Flat design, no shadows. Background: deep teal (#0d9488) rounded square. Symbol: white. Must read clearly at 32×32 pixels. SVG vector style. 512×512 PNG.
```

#### Site-Wide OG Image Background

This is the background template that the programmatic `opengraph-image.tsx` will composite text over. Generate one per site.

```
Design a 1200×630 pixel background image for social sharing cards for [SITE_NAME].
Style:
- Background base: [BASE_COLOR — e.g. #0f172a for dark sites, #ffffff for light]
- Subtle geometric pattern: [PATTERN — e.g. "faint diagonal grid lines at 15° angle, 4px spacing, 6% opacity in [ACCENT_COLOR]"]
- One design accent: [e.g. "a soft glow in the bottom-left corner in [ACCENT_COLOR] at 15% opacity" or "a thin horizontal rule in [ACCENT_COLOR] at the bottom third"]
- No text, no people, no stock photography, no logos
- The image must work as a background behind large white or dark text
- Overall mood: [MOOD — professional / technical / warm / playful]
Output: 1200×630 PNG.
```

#### Homepage Hero Illustration

For sites that warrant a hero illustration above the tool grid (use sparingly — tool-first is the priority):

```
Flat vector illustration for [SITE_NAME] homepage.
Shows: [CONCEPT — e.g. "a smartphone scanning a QR code, with a URL appearing as a floating tag. Clean and simple." / "three browser windows at different widths showing the same website adapting its layout"]
Style: 
- Flat illustration, clean vector shapes, no photorealism
- 2–3 colors only: [COLOR1], [COLOR2], and white
- Friendly but professional — utility tool audience, not children's app
- No faces or people (abstract enough to be timeless)
- No fine details — should read clearly at 600px wide
Output: 800×500 PNG, transparent background.
```

#### Tool Page Decorative Element (Optional)

A small icon or illustration at the top of each tool page, distinct from the standard Lucide/Heroicons set:

```
Create a minimal decorative icon for a [TOOL_NAME] tool page.
The icon shows [CONCEPT — e.g. "a contrast meter showing two color bars" / "a QR code with a cursor scanning it"].
Style: flat, 2 colors ([COLOR1] and [COLOR2]), bold and simple, no fine detail.
Output: 64×64 PNG, transparent background.
```

---

### Tool Interface Design Rules

The tool widget itself is the most important element on the page. These rules apply to every tool:

- **Tool must be the first interactive element a user sees** — above the fold on mobile (375px width, 667px height as the minimum viewport to test against). No hero image, no large intro paragraph before the tool.
- **Zero state is welcoming** — when the tool loads with no input, it should show a clear visual invitation: a prominent upload area with a dashed border, a labeled input field, or a button with descriptive text. The user should never wonder what to do.
- **Result state is satisfying** — when the tool produces output, the result should be visually distinct from the input state. Use a subtle animation (150–200ms ease-out), a color change, or a clearly differentiated output area. Make it feel like the tool *did something*.
- **Error state is human** — if input is invalid, show a gentle, specific message next to the relevant field. Never a generic "error." Never red text that looks like the page broke.
- **Download/copy CTA is prominent** — if the tool produces a file or text output, the "Copy" or "Download" button must be the most visually prominent element in the result state. This is the action that completes the user's task. Make it obvious.
- **Mobile interaction targets** — all buttons and interactive elements must be at minimum 44×44px touch targets on mobile.

---

### Dark Mode

Every site should support dark mode. In Next.js + Tailwind:

1. Add `darkMode: 'class'` to `tailwind.config.ts`
2. Apply `dark:` variants to all color classes
3. Use `next-themes` for theme persistence without flash:
   ```bash
   npm install next-themes
   ```
4. Wrap the root layout in `<ThemeProvider attribute="class" defaultTheme="system" enableSystem>`
5. Provide a toggle button in the site header

Design dark mode with intention — do not just invert colors. Dark backgrounds should use deep slate/navy tones (`#0f172a`, `#0c0a09`, `#09090b`) with text at `zinc-100` or `slate-100`, not pure white. Tool output areas can use a slightly lighter dark surface (`#1e293b`) to create visual separation.

---

### Launch Design Checklist

Before any site goes live:
- [ ] A specific color palette is defined in `tailwind.config.ts` (not default Tailwind colors)
- [ ] Typography scale is defined with at least two distinct weights used
- [ ] Font loaded via `next/font` (not CDN import)
- [ ] Dark mode implemented and tested
- [ ] Favicon generated (not a letter or default Next.js icon) — use the ChatGPT prompt above
- [ ] OG image background generated (not a plain color) — use the ChatGPT prompt above
- [ ] Per-tool dynamic OG images working (`opengraph-image.tsx`)
- [ ] Tool zero state is welcoming (clear visual invitation, no blank/confusing default)
- [ ] Tool result state is visually satisfying (animation or clear visual transition)
- [ ] All tool action buttons ≥ 44×44px on mobile
- [ ] No default Tailwind blue (#3B82F6) used as primary brand color
- [ ] No CSS blob/orb hero backgrounds
- [ ] Footer has brand identity (not just four gray columns)
- [ ] Breadcrumb nav rendered and styled consistently

---

## 4. SEO Implementation

### Root Metadata (`app/layout.tsx`)
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL ?? 'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]'),
  title: {
    default: '[Site Name] — [One-line value proposition]',
    template: '%s | [Site Name]',
  },
  description: '[130–160 char description of what the site does]',
  robots: { index: true, follow: true, googleBot: { index: true, follow: true } },
  openGraph: {
    type: 'website',
    locale: 'en_GB',
    url: 'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]',
    siteName: '[Site Name]',
    images: [{ url: '/og-image.png', width: 1200, height: 630, alt: '[Site Name]' }],
  },
  twitter: { card: 'summary_large_image', images: ['/og-image.png'] },
  icons: {
    icon: [{ url: '/favicon-32x32.png', sizes: '32x32' }, { url: '/favicon-16x16.png', sizes: '16x16' }],
    shortcut: '/favicon.ico',
    apple: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
  },
}
```

### Organization Schema (Root Layout)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "[Site Name]",
  "url": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]",
  "logo": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/og-image.png",
  "description": "[One-line description]",
  "contactPoint": { "@type": "ContactPoint", "contactType": "customer support", "url": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/contact" }
}
```

### Homepage Schema (in addition to Organization)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "[Site Name]",
  "url": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]",
  "potentialAction": {
    "@type": "SearchAction",
    "target": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/search?q={search_term_string}",
    "query-input": "required name=search_term_string"
  }
}
```

### Tool Page Metadata Pattern (`app/[tool-slug]/page.tsx`)
```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  return {
    title: tool.title,               // e.g. "Dead Pixel Test — Free Online Monitor Checker"
    description: tool.metaDesc,      // 130–160 chars, includes primary keyword
    alternates: { canonical: `${appUrl}/${slug}` },
    openGraph: {
      title: tool.title,
      description: tool.metaDesc,
      url: `${appUrl}/${slug}`,
      type: 'website',
    },
  }
}
```

### Tool Page Schema (inject in `<head>`)

**WebApplication schema** (correct type for browser-based tools — use `WebApplication`, not `SoftwareApplication`):
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebApplication",
  "name": "[Tool Name]",
  "applicationCategory": "UtilitiesApplication",
  "operatingSystem": "Web Browser",
  "offers": { "@type": "Offer", "price": "0", "priceCurrency": "USD" },
  "description": "[Tool description]",
  "url": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/[tool-slug]",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.8",
    "ratingCount": "124"
  }
}
```
Note: `aggregateRating` is required to unlock the star-rating rich result in SERPs. Add a simple browser-side star rating widget to each tool page so users can rate it. Without this, no star rating will appear. Update `ratingValue` and `ratingCount` from your data.

**FAQPage schema** (include on every tool page, but do NOT expect a rich result in SERPs):
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    { "@type": "Question", "name": "[Q]", "acceptedAnswer": { "@type": "Answer", "text": "[A]" } }
  ]
}
```
**Important — FAQPage rich results are dead for new utility sites.** Google restricted FAQ rich results to government and health authority sites in 2023–2024. You will not see accordion-style FAQ in SERPs for a tool portfolio. Still implement FAQPage schema because: (1) it helps AI Overviews parse your content for citations, and (2) the FAQ content itself answers long-tail queries. But do not build your SEO expectations around SERP visual enhancements from this schema.

**HowTo schema: do not implement.** HowTo rich results were fully deprecated in 2024–2025 and produce no SERP benefit. Use clear prose and step-by-step HTML instead.

**BreadcrumbList schema** (every page):
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "name": "Home", "item": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]" },
    { "@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "name": "[Tool Name]", "item": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/[tool-slug]" }
  ]
}
```

### Blog Post Schema (`app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`)
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "[Post title]",
  "description": "[Post meta desc]",
  "author": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "[Site Name]" },
  "publisher": { "@type": "Organization", "name": "[Site Name]", "logo": { "@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/og-image.png" } },
  "datePublished": "[ISO date]",
  "mainEntityOfPage": { "@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/blog/[slug]" }
}
```

### Sitemap (`app/sitemap.ts`)
```typescript
export default function sitemap(): MetadataRoute.Sitemap {
  return [
    { url: appUrl, priority: 1.0, changeFrequency: 'weekly' },
    ...tools.map(t => ({ url: `${appUrl}/${t.slug}`, priority: 0.9, changeFrequency: 'monthly' })),
    ...blogPosts.map(p => ({ url: `${appUrl}/blog/${p.slug}`, priority: 0.7, changeFrequency: 'monthly' })),
    { url: `${appUrl}/about`, priority: 0.5 },
    { url: `${appUrl}/privacy`, priority: 0.3 },
    { url: `${appUrl}/terms`, priority: 0.3 },
    { url: `${appUrl}/contact`, priority: 0.4 },
  ]
}
```

### Robots (`app/robots.ts`)
```typescript
export default function robots(): MetadataRoute.Robots {
  return {
    rules: [{ userAgent: '*', allow: '/', disallow: ['/api/', '/admin/'] }],
    sitemap: `${appUrl}/sitemap.xml`,
  }
}
```

### Canonical URLs
Every page must declare:
```typescript
alternates: { canonical: `${appUrl}/[path]` }
```

### Hreflang (Multi-Language Pages)

When language variant pages exist, every language version must reference every other, plus itself, plus an `x-default`. Use the `alternates.languages` property in `generateMetadata()`:

```typescript
export async function generateMetadata({ params }): Promise<Metadata> {
  return {
    alternates: {
      canonical: `https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/${params.locale}/[tool-slug]`,
      languages: {
        'en':        'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/en/[tool-slug]',
        'es':        'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/es/[tool-slug]',
        'fr':        'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/fr/[tool-slug]',
        'de':        'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/de/[tool-slug]',
        'x-default': 'https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/en/[tool-slug]',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Next.js renders these as `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="...">` tags in `<head>`. Rules:
- Every language version must list all others (reciprocity — over 60% of multilingual sites fail this)
- Every page must include a self-referencing hreflang
- `x-default` points to the English/neutral fallback
- Use fully-qualified absolute URLs (include `https://`)
- Also add `<xhtml:link>` hreflang annotations inside your `sitemap.ts` for large sites
- Only launch language variants if the translation is human-reviewed quality — auto-translated pages with no review are a scaled content abuse risk

### Static Generation Pattern (`generateStaticParams`)

Every tool page and variant page must be pre-rendered at build time (SSG). Never use client-side rendering (CSR) for pages you want indexed — Google may delay CSR indexing by days.

```typescript
// app/[tool-slug]/page.tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  return tools.map((tool) => ({ 'tool-slug': tool.slug }))
}

// This is automatically statically generated — no `export const dynamic`
// needed. Never use `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` on tool pages.
```

### Dynamic OG Images Per Tool

Do not use a single site-wide `/og-image.png` for all pages. Generate a per-tool OG image using the `@vercel/og` (Next.js built-in) edge function so each tool has a unique social card:

```typescript
// app/[tool-slug]/opengraph-image.tsx
import { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'

export const runtime = 'edge'
export const alt = '[Tool Name]'
export const size = { width: 1200, height: 630 }
export const contentType = 'image/png'

export default async function Image({ params }) {
  return new ImageResponse(
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column',
                  background: '#0f172a', width: '100%', height: '100%',
                  padding: '80px', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <div style={{ color: '#fff', fontSize: 64, fontWeight: 700 }}>
        {params['tool-slug']} {/* replace with actual tool name */}
      </div>
      <div style={{ color: '#94a3b8', fontSize: 32, marginTop: 24 }}>
        [Site Name] — Free, No Sign-up
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Place this file at `app/[tool-slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` and Next.js automatically generates and serves the image. Unique OG images per tool significantly improve social share click-through rates.

### AI Overviews Optimisation

AI Overviews appear on approximately 50% of all Google queries. Being cited in an AI Overview drives 35% more organic clicks than not being cited. For tool sites, the informational content *around* your tools (the "how to", "what is", "when to use" content) is the AI Overview target — pure transactional tool queries have lower AI Overview appearance rates.

To optimise for AI Overview citations:
- Use **question-format H2 and H3 headings** with a concise (40–100 word) direct answer in the first paragraph below each heading. Example: `<h2>What is a QR code?</h2><p>A QR code is a two-dimensional barcode...` — Google extracts these as citation candidates.
- Ensure `dateModified` is kept current in your Article schema (freshness is weighted).
- **Tool pages must be above the fold and immediately functional** — satisfied users who complete their task without returning to Google are a strong positive engagement signal (NavBoost "long click").
- Cover the tool's topic comprehensively across the tool page + blog posts. Topical depth (not just a single page) drives authority for AI Overview citations.

## 5. Content Requirements per Tool Page

Every tool page must include all of the following:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|------------|
| H1 | Keyword-targeted (e.g. "Free Dead Pixel Test — Check Your Monitor Online") |
| Tool functionality | Fully working in-browser. Zero-state is welcoming and obvious. |
| Tool description | 1–2 paragraphs explaining what it does, who uses it, why it matters |
| SEO body copy | 400–600 words. Covers use cases, how-to, when to use, what results mean |
| FAQs | 6–8 Q&A pairs rendered on page AND as FAQPage JSON-LD schema |
| Internal links | At least 3 links to related tools on the same site |
| "Related tools" section | Rendered as cards/list at bottom of page |
| Meta title | Tool name + benefit + site name via template |
| Meta description | 120–160 chars (mobile truncates at ~120; write the key message in the first 120) |
| Canonical | Explicitly set |
| OG tags | Title, description, image (og-image.png) |

### Content Structure for AI Overviews and Long-Tail

- **Tool must be visible and functional above the fold without scrolling.** Users who complete their task without returning to Google are a positive NavBoost signal. Users who can't find the tool and bounce back to search are a negative signal.
- Use **question-format H2 and H3 headings** in the SEO body copy: "How does [tool] work?", "When should I use [tool]?", "What does [result] mean?" — then answer each in 40–100 words directly below the heading.
- Render a **breadcrumb navigation component** on every page (not just the schema — a visible, clickable breadcrumb trail: Home → [Tool Name]). This reinforces site hierarchy for Google and improves usability.
- Cover the topic comprehensively: a tool page that also explains the concept, shows examples, and lists use cases gets cited in more AI Overviews than a bare tool.

### Copy Rules
- No em dashes anywhere. Use a colon, period, or rewrite.
- Explicitly you may NOT use any em dashes EVER!!!!
- No jargon that requires product knowledge.
- Write for someone who landed from a single Google search and has no context.
- FAQs should answer what the user is actually worried about, not marketing questions.
- Every FAQ answer must be ≥ 40 words (helps AI parsing; FAQPage schema no longer produces rich results for utility sites but still aids long-tail SEO).
- Title tags: 50–60 characters, primary keyword near the start (not the brand name). Google rewrites ~60% of title tags — write accurately, concisely, and user-facing.
- Meta descriptions: write the key message in the first 120 characters (mobile truncation). Google rewrites ~62% of meta descriptions — write them anyway as they influence CTR when Google does use them.

### E-E-A-T Signals (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

E-E-A-T is not a direct algorithmic score, but it correlates with what Google rewards. For a new utility site with no backlinks, focus on Trustworthiness first — it's the most actionable:

- **Trustworthiness:** HTTPS (Vercel handles this), Privacy Policy present and linked in footer, Contact page, clear About page with honest description of what the site does, no false claims about team size or history.
- **Experience:** Show that the tool actually works — include example outputs, screenshots of results, sample inputs. Demonstrate use.
- **Expertise:** Explain concepts accurately. If the tool checks WCAG contrast, explain what WCAG is and why it matters. If it generates QR codes, explain the different use cases and formats. Don't be shallow.
- **Transparency for data-handling tools:** Any tool that processes passwords, emails, or personal information must explicitly state on the tool page that all processing is browser-side and no data is sent to any server. This is both a trust signal and legally important.

## 6. Internal Linking Architecture

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
```
Homepage (tool hub)
  ├── Category group A (e.g. "Generate" tools)
  │     ├── Tool 1 → links to Tools 2, 3, 4 (related)
  │     ├── Tool 2 → links to Tools 1, 3, 5
  │     └── Tool 3 → links to Tools 1, 2, 6
  ├── Category group B (e.g. "Check" tools)
  └── Blog posts → each links to ≥ 2 tool pages
```

### Rules
- Every tool page links to ≥ 3 related tools ("Related Tools" section, rendered as cards)
- Every blog post links to ≥ 2 tool pages (contextual inline links + "Try these tools" section)
- Homepage links to all tools (or all tool categories)
- Category group pages link to all tools within that group
- Navigation links to main category groups
- Footer links to legal/about pages and category groups

---

## 7. Ad Setup

### AdSense Requirements (must be met before applying)
- Real, useful content on every page
- Privacy Policy page present and linked from footer
- Terms of Service page present
- Contact page present
- About page present
- No thin or near-duplicate pages (each tool must be meaningfully distinct)
- No deceptive ad placement (ads must not look like tool buttons)
- Site must be live for at least a few weeks before applying
- Clean navigation (user can always find their way around)
- Mobile-friendly (passes Google Mobile-Friendly Test)
- Core Web Vitals pass (no red metrics in PageSpeed Insights)

### Ad Placement Strategy
- One banner ad above the fold (below tool header, above tool interface) — 728×90 leaderboard on desktop, 320×50 on mobile
- One banner ad below the tool interface — 300×250 rectangle
- One banner ad within the SEO body copy — 300×250 inline
- Never place ads in a way that obscures tool functionality
- Never place ads immediately adjacent to tool action buttons (AdSense policy)

### CLS and Ads (Critical)

Dynamically loaded AdSense units are one of the leading causes of CLS failures. Every ad slot must have a pre-sized fixed-height CSS container before the ad script loads:

```css
.ad-slot {
  min-height: 90px;  /* match the ad unit's declared height */
  width: 100%;
}
```

If ad containers are not pre-sized, the page will fail Core Web Vitals CLS (> 0.1) and may not qualify for AdSense or may see ranking suppression. This is non-negotiable.

### Fallback: Adsterra
If AdSense approval fails:
- Use Adsterra clean banner formats only (no popunders)
- Model revenue at $0.50–$1.50 RPM (not $3)
- Required traffic doubles or triples at this RPM; adjust expectations accordingly

---

## 8. Programmatic SEO

### Language Pages
Every tool should eventually have static pages for major language markets:
- Priority 1: English (default), Spanish, French, Portuguese, German
- Priority 2: Italian, Dutch, Polish, Arabic, Japanese
- Priority 3: Mandarin Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian, Turkish, Russian, Korean, Vietnamese

Language pages use the pattern `/[lang]/[tool-slug]` or a subdomain. Each must be a genuinely translated page, not auto-translated without review. Auto-translated content without editorial oversight is treated as scaled content abuse under Google's 2025 spam policy.

### Tool Variant Pages
Where search demand exists, create variant pages:
- `/[tool-slug]/mobile` — mobile-specific version
- `/[tool-slug]/for-[use-case]` — e.g. `/dead-pixel-test/for-oled`
- `/[tool-slug]/[format]` — e.g. `/qr-generator/svg`

**Content differentiation threshold:** Each variant must have at least 40% genuinely unique content versus the base tool page, and at least 500 unique words. Below this threshold, Google may treat the pages as near-duplicates and only index one.

**Canonical for near-duplicate variants:** If a variant page is not yet differentiated enough (e.g. you've built the URL but not the full unique content), set its canonical to the base tool page until the content is ready. Do not leave under-differentiated pages with their own canonical — they risk diluting the base page's authority.

```typescript
// Temporarily canonical to base page if variant isn't fully differentiated yet
alternates: { canonical: `${appUrl}/[base-tool-slug]` }
```

### AI-Generated Content Policy

You may use AI to draft programmatic page content. You must not publish it without a human editorial pass. The edit should:
- Add original examples, screenshots, or use-case specifics not present in other pages
- Verify technical accuracy
- Ensure the content answers a real user need rather than just pattern-matching other content
- Rewrite any phrasing that is generic, repetitive across pages, or sounds like unedited AI output

Google's scaled content abuse detection has been algorithmically enforced since August 2025. Sites publishing large volumes of AI-generated pages without editorial oversight have reported 50–80% traffic drops. Sites with human oversight reported only ~6% impact.

### Programmatic Blog Support
For each tool cluster, generate blog posts targeting informational queries:
- "How to [task related to tool]"
- "What is [concept related to tool]"
- "Why does [problem the tool solves]"
- "[Tool use case] guide for [audience]"

Minimum 10 blog posts per site at launch. Target 20–30 over time.

---

## 9. Standard Pages (Required for Every Site)

### Privacy Policy
Must include:
- What data is collected (none beyond analytics cookies)
- Cookie usage (Google Analytics, AdSense)
- Third-party advertising (AdSense / Adsterra)
- No user account data collected
- Contact email for privacy queries
- Last updated date

### Terms of Service
Must include:
- Free to use, no warranty
- No liability for tool output
- No account required
- Acceptable use
- Link to privacy policy

### About Page
Must include:
- What the site does (1–2 paragraphs)
- Who it is for
- Why it was built
- No false claims about team size or history

### Contact Page
Must include:
- Contact email (can be a simple form or mailto link)
- Response time expectation

---

## 10. Analytics Setup

From day one, every site must have all of the following:

1. **Google Analytics 4** — track page views, events, tool interactions
2. **Google Search Console** — submit sitemap on launch day, monitor impressions/clicks
3. **Vercel Analytics** — real-time page view tracking, no setup required on Vercel
4. **Bing Webmaster Tools** — verify site and submit sitemap. Bing + Yahoo combined represent 5–15% of search traffic. Required for IndexNow.
5. **IndexNow (Bing)** — ping Bing/Yandex/others instantly when pages are published or updated

### IndexNow Setup

IndexNow is a push-indexing protocol supported by Bing, Yandex, Naver, Seznam, and others. Google does NOT participate. Pages submitted via IndexNow can appear in Bing within minutes to hours (versus days for Google crawl).

**Setup:**
1. In Bing Webmaster Tools, generate your IndexNow API key
2. Save the key as a static file at your domain root: `public/[your-key].txt` (contents = just the key string)
3. When new pages publish or existing pages update significantly, POST to IndexNow:

```typescript
// lib/indexnow.ts
export async function pingIndexNow(urls: string[]) {
  await fetch('https://api.indexnow.org/indexnow', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=utf-8' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      host: '[SITE_DOMAIN]',
      key: process.env.INDEXNOW_KEY,
      keyLocation: `https://[SITE_DOMAIN]/${process.env.INDEXNOW_KEY}.txt`,
      urlList: urls,
    }),
  })
}
```

One submission propagates to all IndexNow participants. Automate this in your deployment pipeline for new pages.

### Key GA4 Events to Track
- `tool_used` — fired when a user interacts with a tool (button click, input submission)
- `page_view` — automatic
- `scroll_depth` — set up 50% and 90% thresholds
- `tool_completed` — fired when a user gets a result (e.g. QR code generated, file processed) — this is a "task completion" signal and helps you understand which tools actually satisfy user intent

---

## 11. Performance Standards

Every page must pass:
- **Core Web Vitals:** LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms
- **PageSpeed Insights mobile score:** ≥ 85
- **Mobile-Friendly Test:** Pass

### INP (Interaction to Next Paint) — Special Attention for Tool Sites

INP replaced FID as the third Core Web Vital in March 2024. INP measures the latency of all user interactions across the full session (at the 75th percentile). It is significantly harder to satisfy than FID for interactive pages.

Tool sites are the most INP-vulnerable site type because users actively click buttons, submit inputs, and trigger processing. A tool that runs heavy JavaScript synchronously after a button click will fail INP even if it loads fast.

To pass INP on tool pages:
- Break heavy processing into smaller chunks using `setTimeout` or `scheduler.postTask()`
- Defer non-critical JavaScript with `async`/`defer`
- Move heavy computation to Web Workers so the main thread stays responsive
- Test INP specifically using Chrome DevTools Performance panel → Interactions track
- Avoid large libraries for simple tasks — write lean tool logic

### To Achieve All Core Web Vitals
- Use `next/image` for all images with `width`, `height`, and `priority` on above-fold images
- Pre-size all ad slot containers with fixed `min-height` in CSS before AdSense scripts load (prevents CLS)
- Use `loading="lazy"` on below-fold images
- Static generation (`generateStaticParams`) for all pages — no SSR for tool pages
- Font: load via `next/font` (not Google Fonts CDN) to avoid FOUT and layout shift
- Minimal JavaScript — keep tool logic lean; avoid heavy dependencies
- Test with real devices in Chrome DevTools, not just Lighthouse (Lighthouse doesn't capture real INP well)

## 13. Maintenance Philosophy

**Goal: Zero ongoing maintenance.**

After launch, the only actions required are:
- Monthly: Check Search Console for crawl errors
- Quarterly: Review top-performing tools, consider adding variants
- As needed: Add new tools to the cluster

The site should never require:
- Manual content updates
- Manual price updates
- API key rotation (avoid paid APIs)
- Database maintenance (browser-side only)

If a tool starts to fail (e.g. a browser API is deprecated), fix it. Otherwise, leave it running.

---

## 14. Revenue Targets and Scaling

### Per-Site Targets
| Maturity Stage | Monthly Page Views | Revenue at $3 RPM | Net Profit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Month 1 | ~200 | ~R10 | −R10 (below hosting cost) |
| Month 2 | ~500 | ~R25 | R5 |
| Month 3+ | 1,000/tool avg | ~R1,235 (25 tools) | ~R1,215 |
| Mature | 2,500/tool avg | ~R3,090 | ~R3,070 |

### Portfolio Targets
| Tools Built | Monthly Page Views | Revenue at $3 RPM |
|---|---|---|
| 100 tools (4 sites) | 100,000 | ~R4,950 |
| 250 tools (10 sites) | 250,000 | ~R12,375 |
| 500 tools (20 sites) | 500,000 | ~R24,750 |

### RPM Improvement Levers
- Higher-intent niches (B2B tools, ecommerce tools) → $5–$8 RPM
- US/UK traffic proportion increase → higher RPM
- Non-ad revenue (affiliate links to relevant tools, courses, products) → supplement display ads
- Premium tool version (no ads, extra features) → optional SaaS layer

---

## 15. Build Sequence

### Phase 1: Foundation (Sites 1–3)
Build the top-confidence clusters first:
1. QR & Barcode Toolkit
2. Screen & Monitor Test Lab
3. Audio Check Lab

These three have the highest confidence scores (9/10), clearest commercial adjacency, and simplest tool logic. Use them to establish the shared component library, SEO template, and ad setup.

### Phase 2: Expansion (Sites 4–10)
Build the next tier after AdSense approval:
4. Webcam & Lighting Check Lab
5. Input Device Test Lab
6. Website Launch Check Lab
7. Ecommerce Image Prep Lab
8. Creator Upload Prep Lab
9. File Inspection & Metadata Lab
10. Social Share Preview Lab

### Phase 3: Scale (Sites 11–20)
Build remaining clusters once the model is proving out:
11. Print Layout & Paper Lab
12. Colour & Accessibility Lab
13. Responsive Viewport Preview Lab
14. Email Preview Lab
15. Marketplace Listing Helper Lab
16. Meeting & Presentation Prep Lab
17. Timers & Focus Lab
18. Event Utility Lab
19. Randomiser & Picker Lab
20. Job Application Prep Lab

---

## 16. The Site-Specific Build Handoff Template

When handing a site to a build agent, provide:

1. **This master framework** (the document you are reading now)
2. **The site-specific build framework** (from the site's folder — covers site name, domain, audience, tools, keywords, commercial adjacency)
3. **The tools list** (from the site's folder — all 25 tools with descriptions and search queries)

The agent should build the complete site without returning until it is done, including:
- All tool pages (functional + SEO content + schema)
- Homepage
- About, Privacy, Terms, Contact
- Blog (minimum 10 posts targeting informational queries around the tools)
- Sitemap, robots.txt
- Analytics setup
- OG image placeholder
- Favicon placeholder
- Internal linking complete

The site is not done until every item on the Launch Checklist (Section 12) is ticked.
